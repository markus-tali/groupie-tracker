## Info

Groupie Trackers is a web-based project that uses a provided API to display information about bands and artists. The API covers details like artist backgrounds, concert locations, dates, and how they interrelate. The website aims to present this data in a user-friendly manner using various visualization methods. A significant feature is its client-server interactions, where user actions fetch data from the server, following a request-response model.
Groupie tracker visualizations consists of manipulating the data coming from the API and displaying it in the most presentable way possible to you.
